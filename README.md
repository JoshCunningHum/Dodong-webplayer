# Dodong-webplayer
 A webplayer support for nizeic's Dodong Discord Music Bot

## Note
Change `discordBotUrl` on `config.js` under `/public/` folder
```js
var discordBotUrl = "DISCORD BOT URL HERE"; 
```
yes, I know. Why not use environment variables? That's because the web player is a static page and structuring on dynamic pages without a base design/plan is a hassle.
After all of the main functions in [here](https://github.com/nizeic/Dodong/pull/9) is finished. I'll build a new branch for a dynamic web player.
